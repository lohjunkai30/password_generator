# Password Generator 

## Project Description

This was an upload of an earlier project of mine whereby I experimented with python terminal input interface, random modules and string manipulation. This password generator is able to customise your generated password based on common requirements requested during creation of accounts

## Tech Stack

**-Language: Python 3.x**
**Modules: random, string**

## Generator Logic

1. Obtain the exact requirements of the password (Length, Number of Uppercase, Number of Numbers, Number of Special Characters)
2. Fulfill the special requirements (Number of Uppercase, Number of Numbers, Number of Special Characters) through random module
3. Fill in the remaining lowercase characters to meet the password desired length
4. Randomly shuffle the sequence of the string to obtain the finalised password

## Project Background

I wanted to apply my knowledge of python into something interesting and potentially useful. It also helped me improve my handling of the terminal input interface and experimenting with simple loop logic and random modules.

### Improvements

Now that I have created a full-stack project with the financial analysis system, I want to try to incorporate this into my own password generator:

1. I want to store generated passwords in a SQL database for future pulling.

2. Add an option in the interface to pull their passwords or input their current exisiting passwords to be tracked.
